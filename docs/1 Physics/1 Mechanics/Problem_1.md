$${\Large Theoretical\;\;Foundation}:\;{\large Deriving\;the\;Governing\;Equations\;of Motion}$$

Projectile motion can be described by breaking the motion into horizontal and vertical components, governed by Newton's laws and the influence of gravity.

${\large Horisontal\; Motion:}$

In the absence of horizontal forces (air resistance is neglected), the horizontal velocity remains constant: $${\large v_x=v_0 \cos(\theta)}$$

From this formula we could express horizontal position as a function of time:
$${\large x(t)=v_0 \cos(\theta)t}$$

${\large Vertical\;Motion}:$

The vertical velocity is affected by gravity: $${\large v_y(t)=v_0 \sin(\theta)-gt}$$

The vertical position is:$${\large y(t)=v_0\sin(\theta)t-\frac{1}{2}gt^2}$$
