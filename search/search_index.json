Newton's Laws and Projectile Motion: Newton's First Law (Inertia): An object resists changes in its motion. Without horizontal forces (neglecting air resistance), a projectile's horizontal velocity remains constant. Newton's Second Law (F=ma): Force causes acceleration. Gravity is the dominant force in projectile motion, acting downwards. This leads to a constant downward acceleration, affecting the vertical velocity. Combined Effect: These laws create independent horizontal (constant velocity) and vertical (changing velocity due to gravity) motions. This combination results in the characteristic parabolic path of a projectile. Horizontal Motion: In the absence of horizontal forces (air resistance is neglected), the horizontal velocity remains constant: \\[ v_x=v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\] From this formula we could express horizontal position as a function of time: \\[ x(t)=v_0 \\cos(\\theta)t \\] Here are some differential equations for horizontal motion: Constant Velocity: $$ \\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = 0 $$ Motion with Constant Acceleration: $$ \\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = a $$ Motion with Air Resistance (Proportional to Velocity): $$ m \\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = -k \\frac{dx}{dt} $$ Animation Vertical motion: The vertical velocity is affected by gravity: $$ {\\large v_y(t)=v_0 \\sin(\\theta)-gt} $$ The vertical position is: \\[ {\\large y(t)=v_0\\sin(\\theta)t-\\frac{1}{2}gt^2} \\] Here are some differential equations for vertical motion: Free Fall (No Air Resistance): $$ \\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} = -g $$ Motion with Constant Acceleration (Upward or Downward): $$ \\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} = a $$ Motion with Air Resistance (Proportional to the Square of Velocity): $$ m \\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} = -mg - k \\left( \\frac{dy}{dt} \\right)^2 $$ Animation Analasys of the range: Dependence of Range on Angle of Projection The range ( \\(R\\) ) of a projectile is the total horizontal distance it covers before returning to the initial vertical level. Using kinematic equations and assuming air resistance is negligible, the range is given by: \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] From this equation, we observe that: The range depends on the sine of twice the launch angle \\(2\\theta\\) . It reaches its maximum value when \\(\\sin(2\\theta) = 1\\) , which occurs at \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) . At 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0, \\(\\sin(2\\theta) = 0\\) , resulting in no horizontal range. Animation Impact of Other Parameters on the Range 1. Effect of Initial Velocity ( \\(v_0\\) ) The range is proportional to the square of the initial velocity ( \\(v_0^2\\) ). Increasing \\(v_0\\) leads to a significantly larger range, while decreasing \\(v_0\\) reduces the distance traveled. Example: Doubling \\(v_0\\) results in a fourfold increase in range. 2. Influence of Gravitational Acceleration ( \\(g\\) ) Since \\(g\\) appears in the denominator, a higher gravitational acceleration results in a shorter range. In environments with lower gravity (e.g., the Moon), the projectile travels much farther. Example: The same projectile launched on Earth and on the Moon (where \\(g_{\\text{Moon}} \\approx \\frac{1}{6} g_{\\text{Earth}}\\) ) would cover six times the range on the Moon.

Comparison of Pendulum Scenarios The plot compares their time evolution numerically, using the full nonlinear equation for accuracy. The time plot (top) shows: (1) the pure pendulum oscillates with constant amplitude, (2) the damped pendulum decays exponentially, (3) the forced pendulum exhibits sustained resonance, and (4) the forced damped case settles into a steady-state oscillation after transient decay. The phase portraits (bottom) reveal: (1) a closed orbit for the pure pendulum, indicating energy conservation; (2) a spiral to the origin for the damped case, showing energy dissipation; (3) a larger repeating orbit for the forced case, driven by external energy; and (4) a transition to a limit cycle for the forced damped case, balancing input and dissipation. Resonance and Energy in a Forced Damped Pendulum In a forced damped pendulum (small-angle approximation), resonance governs long-term behavior and energy dynamics. Resonance Condition Resonance arises when the driving frequency \\(\\omega\\) matches the natural frequency \\(\\omega_0\\) of the undamped system: \\[ \\omega_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{L}} \\] In a damped system, the peak response occurs slightly below the natural frequency: \\[ \\omega_{\\text{res}} = \\sqrt{\\omega_0^2 - \\frac{b^2}{2}} \\] Amplitude at Resonance The amplitude \\(D(\\omega)\\) of the steady-state oscillation is: \\[ D(\\omega) = \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2)^2 + (b \\omega)^2}} \\] At resonance: \\[ D_{\\text{max}} \\approx \\frac{A}{b \\omega_0} \\quad \\text{(when } b \\ll \\omega_0 \\text{)} \\] Lower damping ( \\(b\\) small) \u2192 Higher amplitude near resonance. Energy Implications 1. Energy Input vs Dissipation The external force supplies energy continuously. Damping dissipates it (e.g., via friction). In steady state , energy input equals energy loss. 2. Energy Stored in Oscillations Total energy (approximate): \\[ E(t) = \\frac{1}{2} I \\dot{\\theta}^2 + \\frac{1}{2} I \\omega_0^2 \\theta^2 \\] Substitute \\(\\theta(t) = D \\cos(\\omega t - \\phi)\\) : \\[ E(t) = \\frac{1}{2} I \\omega^2 D^2 \\sin^2(\\omega t - \\phi) + \\frac{1}{2} I \\omega_0^2 D^2 \\cos^2(\\omega t - \\phi) \\] Average energy over a period \\(T = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}\\) : \\[ \\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{1}{4} I D^2 (\\omega^2 + \\omega_0^2) \\] \u2192 Maximum average energy occurs near resonance, where \\(D\\) is largest.

Definitions and Physical Meaning First Cosmic Velocity ( \\(v_1\\) ) : The orbital velocity required for an object to maintain a stable, circular low orbit around a celestial body, just above its surface (neglecting atmospheric drag). It is the speed needed to achieve a satellite orbit, balancing gravitational pull with centripetal force. For Earth, this is the speed for low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. Second Cosmic Velocity ( \\(v_2\\) ) : The escape velocity required for an object to break free from a celestial body\u2019s gravitational field, starting from its surface, and move to infinity without further propulsion. It represents the minimum speed to escape the planet\u2019s gravity entirely, used for interplanetary missions. Third Cosmic Velocity ( \\(v_3\\) ) : The velocity required for an object, launched from a celestial body\u2019s surface (e.g., Earth), to escape the gravitational influence of the central star (e.g., the Sun) and leave the star\u2019s gravitational system (e.g., the Solar System). It is relevant for interstellar travel. 2. Mathematical Derivations Below are the derivations for each cosmic velocity, based on fundamental physics principles (Newtonian gravity and conservation of energy). First Cosmic Velocity ( \\(v_1\\) ) The first cosmic velocity is the speed for a circular orbit near the surface of a celestial body. In a circular orbit, the gravitational force provides the centripetal force required for circular motion. Gravitational force : $$ F_g = \\frac{GMm}{r^2} $$ where \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant ( \\(6.67430 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{m}^3 \\, \\text{kg}^{-1} \\, \\text{s}^{-2}\\) ), \\(M\\) is the mass of the celestial body, \\(m\\) is the mass of the orbiting object, and \\(r\\) is the radius of the orbit (approximately the body\u2019s radius for surface-level orbits). Centripetal force for circular motion: $$ F_c = \\frac{mv_1^2}{r} $$ where \\(v_1\\) is the orbital velocity. Equate the forces: $$ \\frac{GMm}{r^2} = \\frac{mv_1^2}{r} $$ Cancel \\(m\\) (mass of the orbiting object) and simplify: $$ \\frac{GM}{r^2} = \\frac{v_1^2}{r} $$ Multiply through by \\(r\\) : $$ \\frac{GM}{r} = v_1^2 $$ Solve for \\(v_1\\) : $$ v_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}} $$ Alternatively, express in terms of surface gravity \\(g = \\frac{GM}{r^2}\\) , so \\(GM = gr^2\\) . Substitute: $$ v_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{gr^2}{r}} = \\sqrt{gr} $$ Physical Insight : \\(v_1\\) depends on the celestial body\u2019s mass and radius, reflecting the balance between gravity and orbital motion. Second Cosmic Velocity ( \\(v_2\\) ) The second cosmic velocity is the escape velocity, derived using conservation of mechanical energy. An object escaping to infinity has zero total mechanical energy at infinity (kinetic energy = 0, potential energy = 0). Total mechanical energy at the surface (initial state): Kinetic energy: $$ K = \\frac{1}{2} mv_2^2 $$ Gravitational potential energy: $$ U = -\\frac{GMm}{r} $$ Total energy: $$ E_i = \\frac{1}{2} mv_2^2 - \\frac{GMm}{r} $$ At infinity (final state, where \\(r \\to \\infty\\) ): Kinetic energy: $$ K = 0 $$ (velocity = 0 at infinity, minimum case) Potential energy: $$ U = 0 $$ (since \\(U = -\\frac{GMm}{r} \\to 0\\) ) Total energy: $$ E_f = 0 $$ Conservation of energy ( \\(E_i = E_f\\) ): $$ \\frac{1}{2} mv_2^2 - \\frac{GMm}{r} = 0 $$ Cancel \\(m\\) and simplify: $$ \\frac{1}{2} v_2^2 = \\frac{GM}{r} $$ Multiply by 2: $$ v_2^2 = \\frac{2GM}{r} $$ Solve for \\(v_2\\) : $$ v_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}} $$ Using \\(g = \\frac{GM}{r^2}\\) , so \\(GM = gr^2\\) : $$ v_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2gr^2}{r}} = \\sqrt{2gr} $$ Relationship with \\(v_1\\) : $$ v_2 = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot v_1 $$ Physical Insight : Escape velocity is higher than orbital velocity, requiring enough energy to overcome the gravitational potential well. Third Cosmic Velocity ( \\(v_3\\) ) The third cosmic velocity is the speed required to escape the Sun\u2019s gravitational influence, starting from the surface of a planet (e.g., Earth). This involves escaping the planet\u2019s gravity and then achieving escape velocity from the Sun\u2019s gravity at the planet\u2019s orbital distance. Step 1: Escape the planet\u2019s gravity : The object needs at least the second cosmic velocity ( \\(v_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM_p}{r_p}}\\) ) to escape the planet (mass \\(M_p\\) , radius \\(r_p\\) ). Step 2: Escape the Sun\u2019s gravity : At the planet\u2019s orbital distance from the Sun ( \\(R\\) , e.g., 1 AU for Earth), the object must achieve the escape velocity from the Sun\u2019s gravitational field: $$ v_{\\text{esc,Sun}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM_s}{R}} $$ where \\(M_s\\) is the Sun\u2019s mass ( \\(1.989 \\times 10^{30} \\, \\text{kg}\\) ). Orbital velocity of the planet : The planet orbits the Sun at velocity \\(v_{\\text{orb}}\\) , derived from circular orbit dynamics: $$ \\frac{GM_s}{R^2} = \\frac{v_{\\text{orb}}^2}{R} \\implies v_{\\text{orb}}^2 = \\frac{GM_s}{R} \\implies v_{\\text{orb}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM_s}{R}} $$ Total velocity required : After escaping the planet, the object is at the planet\u2019s orbital distance, moving at the planet\u2019s orbital velocity \\(v_{\\text{orb}}\\) . To escape the Sun, it needs an additional velocity to reach \\(v_{\\text{esc,Sun}}\\) . The velocity relative to the Sun after escaping the planet is: $$ v_{\\text{rel}} = \\sqrt{v_2^2 + v_{\\text{orb}}^2} $$ However, the precise derivation for \\(v_3\\) assumes the object must achieve \\(v_{\\text{esc,Sun}}\\) relative to the Sun. The additional velocity needed beyond \\(v_{\\text{orb}}\\) : $$ v_{\\text{add}} = v_{\\text{esc,Sun}} - v_{\\text{orb}} $$ Simplified \\(v_3\\) : For Earth, the third cosmic velocity is often approximated by considering the total energy to escape both Earth and the Sun. A practical formula, accounting for Earth\u2019s orbital velocity and escape requirements, is derived numerically or via energy considerations. The approximate formula for \\(v_3\\) (from Earth\u2019s surface to escape the Solar System) is: $$ v_3 \\approx \\sqrt{v_2^2 + (v_{\\text{esc,Sun}} - v_{\\text{orb}})^2} $$ However, standard references provide: $$ v_3 \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM_s}{R} + v_2^2} $$ This is complex, so we compute numerically below using known values. Physical Insight : \\(v_3\\) accounts for escaping two gravitational fields, making it significantly higher than \\(v_2\\) . 3.

This involves escaping the planet\u2019s gravity and then achieving escape velocity from the Sun\u2019s gravity at the planet\u2019s orbital distance. Step 1: Escape the planet\u2019s gravity : The object needs at least the second cosmic velocity ( \\(v_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM_p}{r_p}}\\) ) to escape the planet (mass \\(M_p\\) , radius \\(r_p\\) ). Step 2: Escape the Sun\u2019s gravity : At the planet\u2019s orbital distance from the Sun ( \\(R\\) , e.g., 1 AU for Earth), the object must achieve the escape velocity from the Sun\u2019s gravitational field: $$ v_{\\text{esc,Sun}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM_s}{R}} $$ where \\(M_s\\) is the Sun\u2019s mass ( \\(1.989 \\times 10^{30} \\, \\text{kg}\\) ).

The velocity relative to the Sun after escaping the planet is: $$ v_{\\text{rel}} = \\sqrt{v_2^2 + v_{\\text{orb}}^2} $$ However, the precise derivation for \\(v_3\\) assumes the object must achieve \\(v_{\\text{esc,Sun}}\\) relative to the Sun.

Elliptical Orbit ( \\(v_{\\text{circular}} < v < v_{\\text{escape}}\\) , \\(E < 0\\) ) : Bound orbit with varying altitude (e.g., LEO, GPS satellites).

Q1. Determine if \\(f(x) = 2x + 3\\) is one-to-one. To check if a function is one-to-one (injective), we need to show that if \\(f(a) = f(b)\\) , then \\(a = b\\) . If \\(f(a) = f(b)\\) . Then: \\( \\(2a + 3 = 2b + 3\\) \\) Subtracting 3 from both sides, we get: \\( \\(2a = 2b\\) \\) Dividing both sides by 2, we get: \\( \\(a = b\\) \\) Therefore, the function \\(f(x) = 2x + 3\\) is one-to-one. Q2. Is \\(f(x) = x^2\\) one-to-one on \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) ? No, the function \\(f(x) = x^2\\) is not one-to-one on the set of real numbers \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) . We can find two different inputs that give the same output. For example: \\( \\(f(2) = 2^2 = 4\\) \\) \\( \\(f(-2) = (-2)^2 = 4\\) \\) Since \\(f(2) = f(-2)\\) but \\(2 \\neq -2\\) , the function is not one-to-one on \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) . Q3. Show that \\(f(x) = \\frac{1}{x}\\) is one-to-one on \\(\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}\\) . Assume \\(f(a) = f(b)\\) for \\(a, b \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}\\) . Then: \\( \\(\\frac{1}{a} = \\frac{1}{b}\\) \\) Multiplying both sides by \\(ab\\) (which is allowed since \\(a \\neq 0\\) and \\(b \\neq 0\\) ), we get: \\( \\(b = a\\) \\) Therefore, the function \\(f(x) = \\frac{1}{x}\\) is one-to-one on \\(\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}\\) . Q4. Is \\(f(x) = 3x + 1\\) onto \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) ? To check if a function is onto (surjective), we need to show that for every \\(y \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) , there exists an \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) such that \\(f(x) = y\\) . Let \\(y\\) be any real number. We want to find \\(x\\) such that: \\( \\(3x + 1 = y\\) \\) Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get: \\( \\(3x = y - 1\\) \\) Dividing both sides by 3, we get: \\( \\(x = \\frac{y - 1}{3}\\) \\) Since for every \\(y \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) , \\(x = \\frac{y - 1}{3}\\) is also a real number and satisfies \\(f(x) = y\\) , the function \\(f(x) = 3x + 1\\) is onto \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) . Q5. Is \\(f(x) = e^x\\) onto \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) ? No, the function \\(f(x) = e^x\\) is not onto \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) . The range of the function \\(e^x\\) is \\((0, \\infty)\\) , which is the set of all positive real numbers. There is no real number \\(x\\) such that \\(e^x\\) is non-positive (zero or negative). Therefore, not every element in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) has a pre-image in the domain. Q6. Show that \\(f(x) = x^3\\) is onto \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) . Let \\(y\\) be any real number. We want to find \\(x\\) such that \\(f(x) = y\\) , which means: \\( \\(x^3 = y\\) \\) Taking the cube root of both sides, we get: \\( \\(x = \\sqrt[3]{y}\\) \\) For every real number \\(y\\) , there exists a unique real number \\(x = \\sqrt[3]{y}\\) such that \\(x^3 = y\\) . Therefore, the function \\(f(x) = x^3\\) is onto \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) . Q7. Find the inverse of \\(f(x) = 2x + 5\\) . To find the inverse function, we swap \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) and solve for \\(y\\) . Let \\(y = f(x) = 2x + 5\\) . Swap \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) : \\( \\(x = 2y + 5\\) \\) Now solve for \\(y\\) : \\( \\(x - 5 = 2y\\) \\) \\( \\(y = \\frac{x - 5}{2}\\) \\) Therefore, the inverse function is \\(f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{x - 5}{2}\\) . Q8. Find the inverse of \\(f(x) = \\frac{x - 1}{x + 2}\\) . Let \\(y = f(x) = \\frac{x - 1}{x + 2}\\) . Swap \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) : \\( \\(x = \\frac{y - 1}{y + 2}\\) \\) Now solve for \\(y\\) : \\( \\(x(y + 2) = y - 1\\) \\) \\( \\(xy + 2x = y - 1\\) \\) \\( \\(xy - y = -2x - 1\\) \\) \\( \\(y(x - 1) = -2x - 1\\) \\) \\( \\(y = \\frac{-2x - 1}{x - 1} = \\frac{2x + 1}{1 - x}\\) \\) Therefore, the inverse function is \\(f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{2x + 1}{1 - x}\\) . Q9. Does \\(f(x) = x^2\\) have an inverse over \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) ? No, the function \\(f(x) = x^2\\) does not have an inverse over the set of real numbers \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) . For a function to have an inverse, it must be a bijection (both one-to-one and onto). As shown in Q2, \\(f(x) = x^2\\) is not one-to-one on \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) , so it cannot have an inverse function on this set. Q10. Verify \\(f(f^{-1}(x)) = x\\) for \\(f(x) = 3x - 4\\) . First, let's find the inverse function \\(f^{-1}(x)\\) . Let \\(y = 3x - 4\\) . Swap \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) : \\( \\(x = 3y - 4\\) \\) \\( \\(x + 4 = 3y\\) \\) \\( \\(y = \\frac{x + 4}{3}\\) \\) So, \\(f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{x + 4}{3}\\) . Now, let's compute \\(f(f^{-1}(x))\\) : \\( \\(f(f^{-1}(x)) = f\\left(\\frac{x + 4}{3}\\right) = 3\\left(\\frac{x + 4}{3}\\right) - 4 = (x + 4) - 4 = x\\) \\) Thus, \\(f(f^{-1}(x)) = x\\) is verified. Q11. Show that \\(f(x) = x + 1\\) is a bijection. To show that \\(f(x) = x + 1\\) is a bijection, we need to show that it is both one-to-one and onto. One-to-one: Assume \\(f(a) = f(b)\\) . Then \\(a + 1 = b + 1\\) , which implies \\(a = b\\) . Therefore, \\(f(x)\\) is one-to-one. Onto: Let \\(y\\) be any real number. We want to find \\(x\\) such that \\(f(x) = y\\) , i.e., \\(x + 1 = y\\) . Solving for \\(x\\) , we get \\(x = y - 1\\) . Since for every \\(y \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) , \\(x = y - 1\\) is also a real number, the function is onto. Since \\(f(x) = x + 1\\) is both one-to-one and onto, it is a bijection. Q12. Is \\(f(x) = \\sin x\\) a bijection on \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) ? No, the function \\(f(x) = \\sin x\\) is not a bijection on \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) . Not one-to-one: For example, \\(\\sin(0) = 0\\) and \\(\\sin(\\pi) = 0\\) , but \\(0 \\neq \\pi\\) . Not onto: The range of the function \\(\\sin x\\) is \\([-1, 1]\\) , which is not the entire set of real numbers \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) . For example, there is no \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) such that \\(\\sin x = 2\\) . Therefore, \\(f(x) = \\sin x\\) is not a bijection on \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) . Q13. Find the inverse of \\(f(x) = \\frac{1}{x + 1}\\) . Let \\(y = f(x) = \\frac{1}{x + 1}\\) . Swap \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) : \\( \\(x = \\frac{1}{y + 1}\\) \\) Now solve for \\(y\\) : \\( \\(x(y + 1) = 1\\) \\) \\( \\(xy + x = 1\\) \\) \\( \\(xy = 1 - x\\) \\) \\( \\(y = \\frac{1 - x}{x}\\) \\) Therefore, the inverse function is \\(f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{1 - x}{x}\\) . Q14. Let \\(f(x) = 2x + 3\\) , \\(g(x) = x^2\\) . Find \\((f \\circ g)(x)\\) . The composition of functions \\((f \\circ g)(x)\\) is defined as \\(f(g(x))\\) . \\( \\(f(g(x)) = f(x^2) = 2(x^2) + 3 = 2x^2 + 3\\) \\) Therefore, \\((f \\circ g)(x) = 2x^2 + 3\\) . Q15. Let \\(f(x) = \\sqrt{x}\\) , \\(g(x) = x + 1\\) . Find \\((f \\circ g)(x)\\) and domain. The composition of functions \\((f \\circ g)(x)\\) is defined as \\(f(g(x))\\) . \\( \\(f(g(x)) = f(x + 1) = \\sqrt{x + 1}\\) \\) Therefore, \\((f \\circ g)(x) = \\sqrt{x + 1}\\) . To find the domain of \\((f \\circ g)(x)\\) , we need to consider the domain of the inner function \\(g(x)\\) and the domain of the outer function \\(f(x)\\) after substituting \\(g(x)\\) . * The domain of \\(g(x) = x + 1\\) is all real numbers \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) . * The domain of \\(f(x) = \\sqrt{x}\\) is \\(x \\ge 0\\) . For the composition \\(f(g(x)) = \\sqrt{x + 1}\\) , the argument of the square root must be non-negative: \\( \\(x + 1 \\ge 0\\) \\) \\( \\(x \\ge -1\\) \\) Therefore, the domain of \\((f \\circ g)(x)\\) is \\([-1, \\infty)\\) . Q16. If \\(f(x) = \\frac{1}{x}\\) , \\(g(x) = x^2\\) , find \\((g \\circ f)(x)\\) . The composition of functions \\((g \\circ f)(x)\\) is defined as \\(g(f(x))\\) . \\( \\(g(f(x)) = g\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{x^2}\\) \\) Therefore, \\((g \\circ f)(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2}\\) . The domain of this function is \\(\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}\\) , since \\(x\\) cannot be zero (due to \\(f(x) = \\frac{1}{x}\\) ). Q17. Show that composition of two bijections is a bijection. Let \\(f: A \\to B\\) and \\(g: B \\to C\\) be two bijections. We need to show that their composition \\(g \\circ f: A \\to C\\) is also a bijection, meaning it is both one-to-one and onto. One-to-one: Assume \\((g \\circ f)(a_1) = (g \\circ f)(a_2)\\) for \\(a_1, a_2 \\in A\\) . Then \\(g(f(a_1)) = g(f(a_2))\\) . Since \\(g\\) is one-to-one, it must be that \\(f(a_1) = f(a_2)\\) . Since \\(f\\) is one-to-one, it must be that \\(a_1 = a_2\\) . Therefore, \\(g \\circ f\\) is one-to-one. Onto: Let \\(c \\in C\\) be any element. Since \\(g: B \\to C\\) is onto, there exists a \\(b \\in B\\) such that \\(g(b) = c\\) . Since \\(f: A \\to B\\) is onto, there exists an \\(a \\in A\\) such that \\(f(a) = b\\) . Then \\(g(f(a)) = g(b) = c\\) . For every \\(c \\in C\\) , there exists an \\(a \\in A\\) such that \\((g \\circ f)(a) = c\\) , so \\(g \\circ f\\) is onto. Since \\(g \\circ f\\) is both one-to-one and onto, it is a bijection. Q18. Find \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) such that \\(f \\circ g = \\sqrt{x^2 + 1}\\) . There are many possible answers. One simple possibility is: \\( \\(g(x) = x^2 + 1\\) \\) \\( \\(f(x) = \\sqrt{x}\\) \\) Then \\((f \\circ g)(x) = f(g(x)) = f(x^2 + 1) = \\sqrt{x^2 + 1}\\) . Another possibility is: \\( \\(g(x) = x\\) \\) \\( \\(f(x) = \\sqrt{x^2 + 1}\\) \\) Then \\((f \\circ g)(x) = f(g(x)) = f(x) = \\sqrt{x^2 + 1}\\) . Q19. Is \\(f(x) = \\ln x\\) invertible? Find its inverse. For a function to be invertible, it must be a bijection from its domain to its range. The function \\(f(x) = \\ln x\\) has a domain of \\((0, \\infty)\\) and a range of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) . It is one-to-one because if \\(\\ln a = \\ln b\\) , then \\(a = b\\) . It is onto its range \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) because for every \\(y \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) , there exists an \\(x = e^y \\in (0, \\infty)\\) such that \\(\\ln(e^y) = y\\) . Therefore, \\(f(x) = \\ln x\\) is invertible on its domain \\((0, \\infty)\\) and range \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) . To find its inverse, let \\(y = \\ln x\\) . Swap \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) : \\( \\(x = \\ln y\\) \\) To solve for \\(y\\) , we rewrite the equation in exponential form: \\( \\(e^x = y\\) \\) Therefore, the inverse function is \\(f^{-1}(x) = e^x\\) . Q20. If \\(f(x) = 3x + 2\\) , \\(g(x) = \\frac{x - 2}{3}\\) , show \\(f \\circ g = g \\circ f = x\\) . Let's compute \\(f \\circ g\\) : \\( \\((f \\circ g)(x) = f(g(x)) = f\\left(\\frac{x - 2}{3}\\right) = 3\\left(\\frac{x - 2}{3}\\right) + 2 = (x - 2) + 2 = x\\) \\) Now, let's compute \\(g \\circ f\\) : \\( \\((g \\circ f)(x) = g(f(x)) = g(3x + 2) = \\frac{(3x + 2) - 2}{3} = \\frac{3x}{3} = x\\) \\) Since \\((f \\circ g)(x) = x\\) and \\((g \\circ f)(x) = x\\) , we have shown that \\(f \\circ g = g \\circ f = x\\) . This means that \\(g\\) is the inverse function of \\(f\\) , and \\(f\\) is the inverse function of \\(g\\) .","title":"Problem 3"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_3/#problem-3","text":"","title":"Problem 3"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_3/#trajectories-of-a-freely-released-payload-near-earth","text":"The motion of a payload released near Earth (ignoring air resistance) follows one of the conic section trajectories \u2014 circle , ellipse , parabola , or hyperbola \u2014depending on its initial speed relative to Earth and direction .","title":"Trajectories of a Freely Released Payload Near Earth"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_3/#1-circular-orbit","text":"Condition : \\(v = v_{\\text{circular}}\\) Shape : Circle (special case of ellipse) Energy : Total mechanical energy \\(E < 0\\) Nature : Closed orbit, constant speed and altitude.

Q1. Determine if \\(f(x) = 2x + 3\\) is one-to-one. To check if a function is one-to-one (injective), we need to show that if \\(f(a) = f(b)\\) , then \\(a = b\\) . If \\(f(a) = f(b)\\) . Then: \\( \\(2a + 3 = 2b + 3\\) \\) Subtracting 3 from both sides, we get: \\( \\(2a = 2b\\) \\) Dividing both sides by 2, we get: \\( \\(a = b\\) \\) Therefore, the function \\(f(x) = 2x + 3\\) is one-to-one. Q2. Is \\(f(x) = x^2\\) one-to-one on \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) ? No, the function \\(f(x) = x^2\\) is not one-to-one on the set of real numbers \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) . We can find two different inputs that give the same output. For example: \\( \\(f(2) = 2^2 = 4\\) \\) \\( \\(f(-2) = (-2)^2 = 4\\) \\) Since \\(f(2) = f(-2)\\) but \\(2 \\neq -2\\) , the function is not one-to-one on \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) . Q3. Show that \\(f(x) = \\frac{1}{x}\\) is one-to-one on \\(\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}\\) . Assume \\(f(a) = f(b)\\) for \\(a, b \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}\\) . Then: \\( \\(\\frac{1}{a} = \\frac{1}{b}\\) \\) Multiplying both sides by \\(ab\\) (which is allowed since \\(a \\neq 0\\) and \\(b \\neq 0\\) ), we get: \\( \\(b = a\\) \\) Therefore, the function \\(f(x) = \\frac{1}{x}\\) is one-to-one on \\(\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}\\) . Q4. Is \\(f(x) = 3x + 1\\) onto \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) ? To check if a function is onto (surjective), we need to show that for every \\(y \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) , there exists an \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) such that \\(f(x) = y\\) . Let \\(y\\) be any real number. We want to find \\(x\\) such that: \\( \\(3x + 1 = y\\) \\) Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get: \\( \\(3x = y - 1\\) \\) Dividing both sides by 3, we get: \\( \\(x = \\frac{y - 1}{3}\\) \\) Since for every \\(y \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) , \\(x = \\frac{y - 1}{3}\\) is also a real number and satisfies \\(f(x) = y\\) , the function \\(f(x) = 3x + 1\\) is onto \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) . Q5. Is \\(f(x) = e^x\\) onto \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) ? No, the function \\(f(x) = e^x\\) is not onto \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) . The range of the function \\(e^x\\) is \\((0, \\infty)\\) , which is the set of all positive real numbers. There is no real number \\(x\\) such that \\(e^x\\) is non-positive (zero or negative). Therefore, not every element in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) has a pre-image in the domain. Q6. Show that \\(f(x) = x^3\\) is onto \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) . Let \\(y\\) be any real number. We want to find \\(x\\) such that \\(f(x) = y\\) , which means: \\( \\(x^3 = y\\) \\) Taking the cube root of both sides, we get: \\( \\(x = \\sqrt[3]{y}\\) \\) For every real number \\(y\\) , there exists a unique real number \\(x = \\sqrt[3]{y}\\) such that \\(x^3 = y\\) . Therefore, the function \\(f(x) = x^3\\) is onto \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) . Q7. Find the inverse of \\(f(x) = 2x + 5\\) . To find the inverse function, we swap \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) and solve for \\(y\\) . Let \\(y = f(x) = 2x + 5\\) . Swap \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) : \\( \\(x = 2y + 5\\) \\) Now solve for \\(y\\) : \\( \\(x - 5 = 2y\\) \\) \\( \\(y = \\frac{x - 5}{2}\\) \\) Therefore, the inverse function is \\(f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{x - 5}{2}\\) . Q8. Find the inverse of \\(f(x) = \\frac{x - 1}{x + 2}\\) . Let \\(y = f(x) = \\frac{x - 1}{x + 2}\\) . Swap \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) : \\( \\(x = \\frac{y - 1}{y + 2}\\) \\) Now solve for \\(y\\) : \\( \\(x(y + 2) = y - 1\\) \\) \\( \\(xy + 2x = y - 1\\) \\) \\( \\(xy - y = -2x - 1\\) \\) \\( \\(y(x - 1) = -2x - 1\\) \\) \\( \\(y = \\frac{-2x - 1}{x - 1} = \\frac{2x + 1}{1 - x}\\) \\) Therefore, the inverse function is \\(f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{2x + 1}{1 - x}\\) . Q9. Does \\(f(x) = x^2\\) have an inverse over \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) ? No, the function \\(f(x) = x^2\\) does not have an inverse over the set of real numbers \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) . For a function to have an inverse, it must be a bijection (both one-to-one and onto). As shown in Q2, \\(f(x) = x^2\\) is not one-to-one on \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) , so it cannot have an inverse function on this set. Q10. Verify \\(f(f^{-1}(x)) = x\\) for \\(f(x) = 3x - 4\\) . First, let's find the inverse function \\(f^{-1}(x)\\) . Let \\(y = 3x - 4\\) . Swap \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) : \\( \\(x = 3y - 4\\) \\) \\( \\(x + 4 = 3y\\) \\) \\( \\(y = \\frac{x + 4}{3}\\) \\) So, \\(f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{x + 4}{3}\\) . Now, let's compute \\(f(f^{-1}(x))\\) : \\( \\(f(f^{-1}(x)) = f\\left(\\frac{x + 4}{3}\\right) = 3\\left(\\frac{x + 4}{3}\\right) - 4 = (x + 4) - 4 = x\\) \\) Thus, \\(f(f^{-1}(x)) = x\\) is verified. Q11. Show that \\(f(x) = x + 1\\) is a bijection. To show that \\(f(x) = x + 1\\) is a bijection, we need to show that it is both one-to-one and onto. One-to-one: Assume \\(f(a) = f(b)\\) . Then \\(a + 1 = b + 1\\) , which implies \\(a = b\\) . Therefore, \\(f(x)\\) is one-to-one. Onto: Let \\(y\\) be any real number. We want to find \\(x\\) such that \\(f(x) = y\\) , i.e., \\(x + 1 = y\\) . Solving for \\(x\\) , we get \\(x = y - 1\\) . Since for every \\(y \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) , \\(x = y - 1\\) is also a real number, the function is onto. Since \\(f(x) = x + 1\\) is both one-to-one and onto, it is a bijection. Q12. Is \\(f(x) = \\sin x\\) a bijection on \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) ? No, the function \\(f(x) = \\sin x\\) is not a bijection on \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) . Not one-to-one: For example, \\(\\sin(0) = 0\\) and \\(\\sin(\\pi) = 0\\) , but \\(0 \\neq \\pi\\) . Not onto: The range of the function \\(\\sin x\\) is \\([-1, 1]\\) , which is not the entire set of real numbers \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) . For example, there is no \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) such that \\(\\sin x = 2\\) . Therefore, \\(f(x) = \\sin x\\) is not a bijection on \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) . Q13. Find the inverse of \\(f(x) = \\frac{1}{x + 1}\\) . Let \\(y = f(x) = \\frac{1}{x + 1}\\) . Swap \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) : \\( \\(x = \\frac{1}{y + 1}\\) \\) Now solve for \\(y\\) : \\( \\(x(y + 1) = 1\\) \\) \\( \\(xy + x = 1\\) \\) \\( \\(xy = 1 - x\\) \\) \\( \\(y = \\frac{1 - x}{x}\\) \\) Therefore, the inverse function is \\(f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{1 - x}{x}\\) . Q14. Let \\(f(x) = 2x + 3\\) , \\(g(x) = x^2\\) . Find \\((f \\circ g)(x)\\) . The composition of functions \\((f \\circ g)(x)\\) is defined as \\(f(g(x))\\) . \\( \\(f(g(x)) = f(x^2) = 2(x^2) + 3 = 2x^2 + 3\\) \\) Therefore, \\((f \\circ g)(x) = 2x^2 + 3\\) . Q15. Let \\(f(x) = \\sqrt{x}\\) , \\(g(x) = x + 1\\) . Find \\((f \\circ g)(x)\\) and domain. The composition of functions \\((f \\circ g)(x)\\) is defined as \\(f(g(x))\\) . \\( \\(f(g(x)) = f(x + 1) = \\sqrt{x + 1}\\) \\) Therefore, \\((f \\circ g)(x) = \\sqrt{x + 1}\\) . To find the domain of \\((f \\circ g)(x)\\) , we need to consider the domain of the inner function \\(g(x)\\) and the domain of the outer function \\(f(x)\\) after substituting \\(g(x)\\) . * The domain of \\(g(x) = x + 1\\) is all real numbers \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) . * The domain of \\(f(x) = \\sqrt{x}\\) is \\(x \\ge 0\\) . For the composition \\(f(g(x)) = \\sqrt{x + 1}\\) , the argument of the square root must be non-negative: \\( \\(x + 1 \\ge 0\\) \\) \\( \\(x \\ge -1\\) \\) Therefore, the domain of \\((f \\circ g)(x)\\) is \\([-1, \\infty)\\) . Q16. If \\(f(x) = \\frac{1}{x}\\) , \\(g(x) = x^2\\) , find \\((g \\circ f)(x)\\) . The composition of functions \\((g \\circ f)(x)\\) is defined as \\(g(f(x))\\) . \\( \\(g(f(x)) = g\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{x^2}\\) \\) Therefore, \\((g \\circ f)(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2}\\) . The domain of this function is \\(\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}\\) , since \\(x\\) cannot be zero (due to \\(f(x) = \\frac{1}{x}\\) ). Q17. Show that composition of two bijections is a bijection. Let \\(f: A \\to B\\) and \\(g: B \\to C\\) be two bijections. We need to show that their composition \\(g \\circ f: A \\to C\\) is also a bijection, meaning it is both one-to-one and onto. One-to-one: Assume \\((g \\circ f)(a_1) = (g \\circ f)(a_2)\\) for \\(a_1, a_2 \\in A\\) . Then \\(g(f(a_1)) = g(f(a_2))\\) . Since \\(g\\) is one-to-one, it must be that \\(f(a_1) = f(a_2)\\) . Since \\(f\\) is one-to-one, it must be that \\(a_1 = a_2\\) . Therefore, \\(g \\circ f\\) is one-to-one. Onto: Let \\(c \\in C\\) be any element. Since \\(g: B \\to C\\) is onto, there exists a \\(b \\in B\\) such that \\(g(b) = c\\) . Since \\(f: A \\to B\\) is onto, there exists an \\(a \\in A\\) such that \\(f(a) = b\\) . Then \\(g(f(a)) = g(b) = c\\) . For every \\(c \\in C\\) , there exists an \\(a \\in A\\) such that \\((g \\circ f)(a) = c\\) , so \\(g \\circ f\\) is onto. Since \\(g \\circ f\\) is both one-to-one and onto, it is a bijection. Q18. Find \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) such that \\(f \\circ g = \\sqrt{x^2 + 1}\\) . There are many possible answers. One simple possibility is: \\( \\(g(x) = x^2 + 1\\) \\) \\( \\(f(x) = \\sqrt{x}\\) \\) Then \\((f \\circ g)(x) = f(g(x)) = f(x^2 + 1) = \\sqrt{x^2 + 1}\\) . Another possibility is: \\( \\(g(x) = x\\) \\) \\( \\(f(x) = \\sqrt{x^2 + 1}\\) \\) Then \\((f \\circ g)(x) = f(g(x)) = f(x) = \\sqrt{x^2 + 1}\\) . Q19. Is \\(f(x) = \\ln x\\) invertible? Find its inverse. For a function to be invertible, it must be a bijection from its domain to its range. The function \\(f(x) = \\ln x\\) has a domain of \\((0, \\infty)\\) and a range of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) . It is one-to-one because if \\(\\ln a = \\ln b\\) , then \\(a = b\\) . It is onto its range \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) because for every \\(y \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) , there exists an \\(x = e^y \\in (0, \\infty)\\) such that \\(\\ln(e^y) = y\\) . Therefore, \\(f(x) = \\ln x\\) is invertible on its domain \\((0, \\infty)\\) and range \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) . To find its inverse, let \\(y = \\ln x\\) . Swap \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) : \\( \\(x = \\ln y\\) \\) To solve for \\(y\\) , we rewrite the equation in exponential form: \\( \\(e^x = y\\) \\) Therefore, the inverse function is \\(f^{-1}(x) = e^x\\) . Q20. If \\(f(x) = 3x + 2\\) , \\(g(x) = \\frac{x - 2}{3}\\) , show \\(f \\circ g = g \\circ f = x\\) . Let's compute \\(f \\circ g\\) : \\( \\((f \\circ g)(x) = f(g(x)) = f\\left(\\frac{x - 2}{3}\\right) = 3\\left(\\frac{x - 2}{3}\\right) + 2 = (x - 2) + 2 = x\\) \\) Now, let's compute \\(g \\circ f\\) : \\( \\((g \\circ f)(x) = g(f(x)) = g(3x + 2) = \\frac{(3x + 2) - 2}{3} = \\frac{3x}{3} = x\\) \\) Since \\((f \\circ g)(x) = x\\) and \\((g \\circ f)(x) = x\\) , we have shown that \\(f \\circ g = g \\circ f = x\\) . This means that \\(g\\) is the inverse function of \\(f\\) , and \\(f\\) is the inverse function of \\(g\\) .","title":"---"},{"location":"1%20Physics/3%20Waves/Problem_1/","text":"Problem 1 Interference Patterns on a water surface Step 1: Select a Regular Polygon We choose an equilateral triangle with side length \\(a\\) .

Disadvantages: Low accuracy; errors can accumulate quickly, especially in long simulations or rapidly changing fields. 2. Runge-Kutta Method (4th Order, RK4) The Runge-Kutta 4th order method improves on the Euler method by evaluating the derivatives multiple times within each step and taking a weighted average. It provides significantly better accuracy, even with larger time steps. For velocity and position updates: \\[ \\vec{v}_{n+1} = \\vec{v}_n + \\frac{1}{6}(k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4) \\] \\[ \\vec{r}_{n+1} = \\vec{r}_n + \\frac{1}{6}(l_1 + 2l_2 + 2l_3 + l_4) \\] Exploration of Applications The Lorentz force plays a crucial role in a wide range of physical systems and technologies: 1. Particle Accelerators In devices such as cyclotrons and synchrotrons , charged particles are accelerated using electric fields and steered using magnetic fields. The magnetic component of the Lorentz force causes particles to travel in circular or spiral paths, allowing for repeated acceleration and high energy levels. 2. Mass Spectrometers These instruments separate ions based on their mass-to-charge ratio. As ions move through a magnetic field, the Lorentz force deflects their path. Lighter ions are deflected more than heavier ones, allowing for identification based on the curvature of their trajectory. 3. Plasma Confinement (Fusion Reactors) In magnetic confinement fusion devices like tokamaks , magnetic fields are used to control hot, ionized gases (plasmas). The Lorentz force acts on the charged particles in the plasma, guiding and containing them in complex magnetic field configurations to prevent contact with reactor walls. Relevance of Electric and Magnetic Fields Electric Fields (E): These are used to accelerate charged particles. A particle in an electric field experiences a force in the direction of the field (for positive charges) or opposite (for negative charges). This is essential for initiating and maintaining motion. Magnetic Fields (B): Magnetic fields influence the direction of motion rather than speed, due to the perpendicular nature of the v \u00d7 B term. This results in circular or helical trajectories, enabling control over particle paths without necessarily altering their kinetic energy. Together, electric and magnetic fields allow for precise manipulation of charged particles in both research and technology, from probing atomic structures to achieving nuclear fusion.","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/4%20Electromagnetism/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/4%20Electromagnetism/Problem_1/#lorentz-force","text":"The Lorentz force is a fundamental concept in electromagnetism, describing the force experienced by a charged particle moving in both electric and magnetic fields.

This results in circular or helical trajectories, enabling control over particle paths without necessarily altering their kinetic energy.
