Newton's Laws and Projectile Motion: Newton's First Law (Inertia): An object resists changes in its motion. Without horizontal forces (neglecting air resistance), a projectile's horizontal velocity remains constant. Newton's Second Law (F=ma): Force causes acceleration. Gravity is the dominant force in projectile motion, acting downwards. This leads to a constant downward acceleration, affecting the vertical velocity. Combined Effect: These laws create independent horizontal (constant velocity) and vertical (changing velocity due to gravity) motions. This combination results in the characteristic parabolic path of a projectile. Horizontal Motion: In the absence of horizontal forces (air resistance is neglected), the horizontal velocity remains constant: \\[ v_x=v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\] From this formula we could express horizontal position as a function of time: \\[ x(t)=v_0 \\cos(\\theta)t \\] Here are some differential equations for horizontal motion: Constant Velocity: $$ \\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = 0 $$ Motion with Constant Acceleration: $$ \\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = a $$ Motion with Air Resistance (Proportional to Velocity): $$ m \\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = -k \\frac{dx}{dt} $$ Animation Vertical motion: The vertical velocity is affected by gravity: $$ {\\large v_y(t)=v_0 \\sin(\\theta)-gt} $$ The vertical position is: \\[ {\\large y(t)=v_0\\sin(\\theta)t-\\frac{1}{2}gt^2} \\] Here are some differential equations for vertical motion: Free Fall (No Air Resistance): $$ \\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} = -g $$ Motion with Constant Acceleration (Upward or Downward): $$ \\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} = a $$ Motion with Air Resistance (Proportional to the Square of Velocity): $$ m \\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} = -mg - k \\left( \\frac{dy}{dt} \\right)^2 $$ Animation Analasys of the range: Dependence of Range on Angle of Projection The range ( \\(R\\) ) of a projectile is the total horizontal distance it covers before returning to the initial vertical level. Using kinematic equations and assuming air resistance is negligible, the range is given by: \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] From this equation, we observe that: The range depends on the sine of twice the launch angle \\(2\\theta\\) . It reaches its maximum value when \\(\\sin(2\\theta) = 1\\) , which occurs at \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) . At 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0, \\(\\sin(2\\theta) = 0\\) , resulting in no horizontal range. Animation Impact of Other Parameters on the Range 1. Effect of Initial Velocity ( \\(v_0\\) ) The range is proportional to the square of the initial velocity ( \\(v_0^2\\) ). Increasing \\(v_0\\) leads to a significantly larger range, while decreasing \\(v_0\\) reduces the distance traveled. Example: Doubling \\(v_0\\) results in a fourfold increase in range. 2. Influence of Gravitational Acceleration ( \\(g\\) ) Since \\(g\\) appears in the denominator, a higher gravitational acceleration results in a shorter range. In environments with lower gravity (e.g., the Moon), the projectile travels much farther. Example: The same projectile launched on Earth and on the Moon (where \\(g_{\\text{Moon}} \\approx \\frac{1}{6} g_{\\text{Earth}}\\) ) would cover six times the range on the Moon.

Comparison of Pendulum Scenarios The plot compares their time evolution numerically, using the full nonlinear equation for accuracy. The time plot (top) shows: (1) the pure pendulum oscillates with constant amplitude, (2) the damped pendulum decays exponentially, (3) the forced pendulum exhibits sustained resonance, and (4) the forced damped case settles into a steady-state oscillation after transient decay. The phase portraits (bottom) reveal: (1) a closed orbit for the pure pendulum, indicating energy conservation; (2) a spiral to the origin for the damped case, showing energy dissipation; (3) a larger repeating orbit for the forced case, driven by external energy; and (4) a transition to a limit cycle for the forced damped case, balancing input and dissipation. Resonance and Energy in a Forced Damped Pendulum In a forced damped pendulum (small-angle approximation), resonance governs long-term behavior and energy dynamics. Resonance Condition Resonance arises when the driving frequency \\(\\omega\\) matches the natural frequency \\(\\omega_0\\) of the undamped system: \\[ \\omega_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{L}} \\] In a damped system, the peak response occurs slightly below the natural frequency: \\[ \\omega_{\\text{res}} = \\sqrt{\\omega_0^2 - \\frac{b^2}{2}} \\] Amplitude at Resonance The amplitude \\(D(\\omega)\\) of the steady-state oscillation is: \\[ D(\\omega) = \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2)^2 + (b \\omega)^2}} \\] At resonance: \\[ D_{\\text{max}} \\approx \\frac{A}{b \\omega_0} \\quad \\text{(when } b \\ll \\omega_0 \\text{)} \\] Lower damping ( \\(b\\) small) \u2192 Higher amplitude near resonance. Energy Implications 1. Energy Input vs Dissipation The external force supplies energy continuously. Damping dissipates it (e.g., via friction). In steady state , energy input equals energy loss. 2. Energy Stored in Oscillations Total energy (approximate): \\[ E(t) = \\frac{1}{2} I \\dot{\\theta}^2 + \\frac{1}{2} I \\omega_0^2 \\theta^2 \\] Substitute \\(\\theta(t) = D \\cos(\\omega t - \\phi)\\) : \\[ E(t) = \\frac{1}{2} I \\omega^2 D^2 \\sin^2(\\omega t - \\phi) + \\frac{1}{2} I \\omega_0^2 D^2 \\cos^2(\\omega t - \\phi) \\] Average energy over a period \\(T = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}\\) : \\[ \\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{1}{4} I D^2 (\\omega^2 + \\omega_0^2) \\] \u2192 Maximum average energy occurs near resonance, where \\(D\\) is largest.

Final Relationship: \\(T^2 = \\frac{4 \\pi^2}{G M} r^3\\) , or \\(T^2 \\propto r^3\\) , where \\(T\\) is the period, \\(r\\) is the radius, \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant, and \\(M\\) is the central mass. The relationship between orbital period ( \\(T\\) ) and orbital radius ( \\(r\\) , or semi-major axis \\(a\\) ), described by Kepler's Third Law ( \\(T^2 \\propto a^3\\) ), is crucial in astronomy. Implications: Calculating Masses: By measuring \\(T\\) and \\(a\\) (or \\(r\\) ) of an orbiting body, we can determine the mass ( \\(M\\) ) of the central body: \\(M \\approx \\frac{4\\pi^2 a^3}{GT^2}\\) And vice-versa (if a satellite orbits a planet). Determining Distances: Knowing the central body's mass and the orbital period allows us to calculate the orbital radius: \\(a^3 \\approx \\frac{GMT^2}{4\\pi^2}\\) This is essential for mapping star systems and determining exoplanet distances. Understanding Orbital Dynamics: This relationship helps predict orbits, study their stability, and infer properties of exoplanetary systems, including planetary migration and interactions. \\(T^2 \\propto r^3\\) Analysis Moon\u2019s Orbit Moon's Orbit Parameters: Earth to Moon: \\(r = 3.844 \\times 10^{8}, \\text{m}.\\) Moon: \\(T = 2.36 \\times 10^{6}, \\text{s}.\\) Earth: \\(M = 5.972 \\times 10^{24}, \\text{kg}.\\) \\(G = 6.674 \\times 10^{-11}, \\text{m}^{3}\\text{kg}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-2}\\) .
