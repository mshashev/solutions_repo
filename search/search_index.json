Using kinematic equations and assuming air resistance is negligible, the range is given by: \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] From this equation, we observe that: The range depends on the sine of twice the launch angle ($ 2\\theta $). It reaches its maximum value when $ \\sin(2\\theta) = 1 $, which occurs at $ \\theta = 45^\\circ $. At 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0 , $ \\sin(2\\theta) = 0 $, resulting in no horizontal range. Impact of Other Parameters on the Range 1. Effect of Initial Velocity ($ v_0 $) The range is proportional to the square of the initial velocity ($ v_0^2 $). Increasing $ v_0 $ leads to a significantly larger range, while decreasing $ v_0 $ reduces the distance traveled. Example: Doubling $ v_0 $ results in a fourfold increase in range. 2. Influence of Gravitational Acceleration ($ g $) Since $ g $ appears in the denominator, a higher gravitational acceleration results in a shorter range . In environments with lower gravity (e.g., the Moon), the projectile travels much farther. Example: The same projectile launched on Earth and on the Moon (where $ g_{\\text{Moon}} \\approx \\frac{1}{6} g_{\\text{Earth}} $) would cover six times the range on the Moon.
