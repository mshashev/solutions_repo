Horizontal Motion: In the absence of horizontal forces (air resistance is neglected), the horizontal velocity remains constant: $$ v_x=v_0 \\cos(\\theta)$$ From this formula we could express horizontal position as a function of time: \\( \\(x(t)=v_0 \\cos(\\theta)t\\) \\) Here are some differential equations for horizontal motion: Constant Velocity: \\( \\(\\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = 0\\) \\) Motion with Constant Acceleration: \\( \\(\\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = a\\) \\) Motion with Air Resistance (Proportional to Velocity): \\( \\(m \\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = -k \\frac{dx}{dt}\\) \\) Projectile Motion (Horizontal Component): \\( \\(\\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = 0\\) \\) Vertical motion: The vertical velocity is affected by gravity: \\( \\({\\large v_y(t)=v_0 \\sin(\\theta)-gt}\\) \\) The vertical position is: \\[{\\large y(t)=v_0\\sin(\\theta)t-\\frac{1}{2}gt^2}\\] Here are some differential equations for vertical motion: Free Fall (No Air Resistance): \\( \\(\\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} = -g\\) \\) Motion with Constant Acceleration (Upward or Downward): \\( \\(\\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} = a\\) \\) Motion with Air Resistance (Proportional to the Square of Velocity): \\( \\(m \\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} = -mg - k \\left( \\frac{dy}{dt} \\right)^2\\) \\) Projectile Motion (Vertical Component): \\( \\(\\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} = -g\\) \\) Analasys of the range: Dependence of Range on Angle of Projection The range ($ R $) of a projectile is the total horizontal distance it covers before returning to the initial vertical level. Using kinematic equations and assuming air resistance is negligible, the range is given by: \\[R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g}\\] From this equation, we observe that: The range depends on the sine of twice the launch angle ($ 2\\theta $). It reaches its maximum value when $ \\sin(2\\theta) = 1 $, which occurs at $ \\theta = 45^\\circ $. At 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0 , $ \\sin(2\\theta) = 0 $, resulting in no horizontal range. Impact of Other Parameters on the Range 1. Effect of Initial Velocity ($ v_0 $) The range is proportional to the square of the initial velocity ($ v_0^2 $). Increasing $ v_0 $ leads to a significantly larger range, while decreasing $ v_0 $ reduces the distance traveled. Example: Doubling $ v_0 $ results in a fourfold increase in range. 2. Influence of Gravitational Acceleration ($ g $) Since $ g $ appears in the denominator, a higher gravitational acceleration results in a shorter range . In environments with lower gravity (e.g., the Moon), the projectile travels much farther. Example: The same projectile launched on Earth and on the Moon (where $ g_{\\text{Moon}} \\approx \\frac{1}{6} g_{\\text{Earth}} $) would cover six times the range on the Moon.
